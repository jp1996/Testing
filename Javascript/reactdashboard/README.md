This project uses react, syncfusion, and tailwindcss to customize a dashboard with multiple different data visualization tools, user interactive elements, and theme customizations.

This was completed using a tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5hdo50a2M, which walks through half of the project and the rest was developed independently.
